Iron on Rust

# Rusty Kaspa Cli Fork (Example)
 
An ongoing study of the rusty-kaspa command line interface is to be found in the directory rusty-kaspa-cli-fork. Release v15.2 will need to be downloaded and run locally to follow along in the README there. The cli directory is placed in that directory for reference. The rust there cannot be built due to the cargo configuration for the full project lying at a level higher than the cli directory. 

### Plan for Iron

1. interactive KRC-20 command line wallet
2. Javascript friendly API to the command-line #no webassembly

...

n. Forge with Iron what was to be mere Rust, accumulated and left behind
